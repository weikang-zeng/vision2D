# vision2D
Mini project for master vision2D class

This project is to learn and practice using python-opencv (it is a cross-platform computer vision library that can be used on python).The project is mainly divided into two parts. One part uses a simple test case to test the function of opencv-python. The function involves the conversion of color space, the drawing of shape borders, and noise reduction.The other part uses the functions we have learned. And combine some additional technologies to achieve project goals.The goal of this project is to achieve the following functions (function to manually calibrate the seven colors, function to manually calibrate the 4 sectors, function to identify every paper by its order, function for display information)
